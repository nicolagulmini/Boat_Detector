# Boat Detector 

The purpose of this project is to develop a program that is capable of detecting one or more boats
in an image and also to distinguish the case in which there is not any boat. To do so, the chosen
method is a cascade of weak classifiers, trained on haar features. Once trained different models, the
obtained results were compared.
